# DSP_Coursework
Implementation of an FIR filter and resampling function in C.

Purpose of the coursework was to implement an alogrithm to be run on a RasPi that could demodulate an 800 MB .dat file and separate the left and right audio streams for use in an 8 MB audio file (also .dat format).

"Digital_Signal_Processing_ENGI_4151.pdf" gives an overview of the design and perfomance of the algorithm.

"Spectral_analysis.m" was used to quanitatively (via autocorrelation) and qualitatively (by playing the audio) assess the quality of the output.
